# PySecDB: security commit dataset in Python

## Description

To foster large-scale research on vulnerability mitigation and to enable a comparison of different detection approaches, we make our dataset ***PySecDB*** from our ICSME23 paper publicly available. 

PySecDB is a real-world Python security commit dataset that contains around 1.2K security commits and 2.8K non-security commits. You can find more details on the dataset in the paper *"[Exploring Security Commits in Python](https://csis.gmu.edu/ksun/)"*.
